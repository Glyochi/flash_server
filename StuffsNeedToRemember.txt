--------------LOCK() in python-----------------
A primitive lock is in one of two states, "locked" or "unlocked". It is created in the unlocked state. 
It has two basic methods, acquire() and release(). When the state is unlocked, acquire() changes the 
state to locked and returns immediately. When the state is locked, acquire() blocks until a call to 
release() in another thread changes it to unlocked, then the acquire() call resets it to locked and returns. 
The release() method should only be called in the locked state; it changes the state to unlocked and returns immediately. 
If an attempt is made to release an unlocked lock, a RuntimeError will be raised.
